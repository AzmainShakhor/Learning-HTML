    <section id="html">
    <img src="images/learn-css.png" alt="">
    <div class="text">
    <p><b>What is CSS?</b></p>

       <p> Every modern browser comes with a set of devtools. Learn it. Use it. You can, very easily :</p><br>
        
     <p>1.See which CSS was applied <br>
        2.See computed padding, margin, border, offset of any element <br>
        3.See which fonts are rendered <br>
        4.Simulate a smaller device <br>
        5.Try new things directly on the browser</p>
